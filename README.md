# Balboa Spa Client integration for home-assistant
Home assistant integration for a spa equipped with a Balboa BP system and a
bwaâ„¢ Wi-Fi Module (50350).

## Configuration

There is a config flow for the spa.  After installing, 
go to integrations in HACS, hit + to setup a new integration, search for "Balboa Spa Client",
select that, and add the IP address or hostname of your spa's wifi adapter.

If you have a blower, it will be listed as a "fan" in the climate device for
the spa.  Currently the code assumes you have a 3-speed blower, if you only
have a 1-speed, only use LOW and OFF.
